    <p id="pp2">Darker roasts require cooler temperature water. If the water temperature is too high, the brew will easily over extract and taste bitter
        Lighter roasts require higher temperature water. Light roasts are more dense and need hotter temperatures to extract the flavours.
        Dark roasts require 1 setting coarser than the usual ‘Pour Over’ setting. When ordering from our website for darker roasts, use the ‘filter coffee’ grind. Or if grinding at home, your grind should look closer to ground peppercorns than sea salt
        A ‘bloom’ is the first pour into your coffee left for 30 secs to provoke the release of carbon dioxide which you can see in the form of tiny bubbles being released in your coffee
        Mixing the coffee grinds in your first pour of water is also known as ‘agitating’ the bloom.. This is essential in light to medium roasts since it helps further release trapped gas allowing the remaining water to absorb more flavour from your coffee grinds, and to reduce sourness in your cup.
        No agitation is needed during the bloom in dark roasts, this will cause over extraction.
        If your water drips through too fast and the brew is finished before the ideal finish time, use a finer grind. If it drips too slowly, use a coarser grind.</p>

    <p id="pp3">The idea of Black Baza Coffee did not come from us at all. It came from coffee growers themselves and it was the idea of creating a local, participatory and meaningful movement for coffee - starting with India and hopefully elsewhere as well. The idea of Black Baza Coffee holds within it a want for an alternative - a production and market system which values producers and nature equally..</p>

   <p id="pp5">What began in late 2013 as an attempt to make some truly remarkable coffee from Tej’s farm in Coorg more accessible to friends and family across cities soon grew into one of India’s leading online coffee brands in just a few years! The intentions were humble - a true coffee drinker didn’t really have much of a choice when it came to home-brewing with quality coffee beans. The stuff found on supermarket shelves was roasted anywhere between a month to a whopping 6 months ago. The Flying Squirrel was here to solve this problem. We started at the estate level, working with India’s (and possibly one among the world’s) finest coffee consultant. We looked at how we could use our natural soil, climate and water conditions to work better for us, to create better coffee beans. We experimented with different cultivars, varying growing conditions, inter-cropping, different methods of processing, drying, storing and roasting - and various permutations and combinations of the same, followed by copious amounts of cupping. We finally settled on 6 perfectly diverse, beautiful coffees. And then, our online store www.flyingsquirrel.in saw the light of day.</p>
